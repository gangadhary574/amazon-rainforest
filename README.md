The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest spread across the lands of South American continent. The forest covers geographical lands in countries Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana hosting ecosystems for more than 3 million animal and plant species. Studies suggest this natural beauty absorbs almost 2.2 billion tons of CO2 every year and is so righteously called the "Lungs of the Earth".

## Few facts about The Amazon Rainforest

1. Amazon rainforest produces more than 20% of earths oxygen and absorbs almost 2.2 billion tons of Carbondioxide from earths atmosphere.
1. The thickness of the canopy (i.e; braches and leaves of the trees) push the forest into almost permanent darkness, as even the rainfall takes 10 minutes to reach the ground surface. 
1. Spreaded over 5.5 million sq.km, the forest covers 40% of South American lands. 
1. 30 million people, including 350 indigenous and ethnic groups, live in the Amazon.
1. The Amazon is home to fascinating and deadly creatures, including electric eels, flesh eating piranhas, poison dart frogs, jaguars and some seriously venomous snakes.

## Threats to Amazon

- Ranching and Agriculture have led to continuous deforestration contributing to climate change, releasing over 340 million tonnes of carbondioxide every year. 
- Due to its rich vegetation, the forest waters and lands have been subjected to illegal activities of commercial fishing and Bio- Piracy Smuggling.
